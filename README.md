📊 Summary of Findings regarding to Wheather:

1.	🌡️ Temperature vs. Latitude:

o	Northern Hemisphere: Strong correlation (r² = 0.7189)—temperature decreases with latitude.
o	Southern Hemisphere: Moderate correlation (r² = 0.4035)—weaker than the Northern Hemisphere.

2.	💧 Humidity vs. Latitude:

o	Northern Hemisphere: Weak correlation (r² = 0.1316)—minimal latitude effect.
o	Southern Hemisphere: Very weak correlation (r² = 0.0425)—largely independent of latitude.

3.	☁️ Cloudiness vs. Latitude:

o	Northern Hemisphere: Negligible correlation (r² = 0.0348)—dependent on local factors.
o	Southern Hemisphere: Weak correlation (r² = 0.1102)—slightly latitude-influenced.

4.	🌬️ Wind Speed vs. Latitude:

o	Northern Hemisphere: No meaningful correlation (r² = 0.0055)—latitude-independent.
o	Southern Hemisphere: Very weak correlation (r² = 0.0856)—dominated by other factors.

📌 Conclusion: 

Temperature exhibits the strongest correlation with latitude, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, while other variables like humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed show minimal to no relationship with latitude, being influenced more by local conditions.

🌍 Summary of Findings regarding to Vacation:
🌟 Ideal Weather Cities:

o 8 cities were identified with perfect weather conditions: 20°C ≤ Max Temp ≤ 25°C, Humidity < 50%, and Clear Skies (Cloudiness = 0).

🏨 Hotel Search:

o 4 cities had nearby hotels (e.g., Hôtel Paris in Smara, Hotel San Francisco in San Juan).
o 4 cities lacked hotels within a 10 km radius (No hotel found).

🗺️ Interactive Map:

oCities are displayed on a map with humidity levels (size and color of points) and hotel info in hover messages.

📌 Conclusion:

The map and analysis highlight great travel destinations with favorable weather and nearby hotels. Some cities offer opportunities for adventure where accommodations are scarce.
