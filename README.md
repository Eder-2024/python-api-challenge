📊 Summary of Findings regarding to Wheather:

🌡️ Temperature vs. Latitude:
Northern Hemisphere: Strong correlation (r² = 0.7924)—temperature decreases significantly as latitude increases.

Southern Hemisphere: Moderate correlation (r² = 0.2819)—weaker trend compared to the Northern Hemisphere, possibly due to geographical differences.

💧 Humidity vs. Latitude:
Northern Hemisphere: Weak correlation (r² = 0.0708)—latitude has little effect on humidity.

Southern Hemisphere: Weak correlation (r² = 0.1566)—latitude slightly influences humidity levels.

☁️ Cloudiness vs. Latitude:
Northern Hemisphere: Minimal correlation (r² = 0.0454)—cloudiness is not latitude-dependent.

Southern Hemisphere: Weak correlation (r² = 0.1052)—latitude has a minor influence on cloudiness.

🌬️ Wind Speed vs. Latitude:
Northern Hemisphere: Virtually no correlation (r² = 0.0156)—wind speed is independent of latitude.

Southern Hemisphere: Weak correlation (r² = 0.1503)—latitude has some effect, though other factors dominate.

📌 General Summary: Temperature has the strongest relationship with latitude, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Other variables like humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed show weak correlations, suggesting more localized influences.

🌍 Summary of Findings regarding to Vacation:
🌟 Ideal Weather Cities:

Filtered for comfortable weather (20°C ≤ Max Temp ≤ 25°C, Humidity < 50%, Clear Skies) and identified 9 cities worldwide.

🏨 Hotel Search:

Hotels Found: 6 cities had nearby hotels (e.g., Hotel Polo Orchid in Tura, Comfort Rooms in Cabo San Lucas).

No Hotels Found: 3 cities lacked hotels within a 10 km radius (e.g., Taoudenni, Three Points).

🗺️ Interactive Map:

Cities are displayed with humidity levels (size and color of points) and hotel information included in hover messages.

📌 Conclusion:

The analysis highlights potential travel destinations with favorable weather and nearby accommodations. Cities with no nearby hotels could be considered more remote or suitable for off-the-grid travelers.
